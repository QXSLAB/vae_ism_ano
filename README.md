This repo provide code and dataset for paper "Unsupervised Spectrum Anomaly Detection Method for Unauthorized Bands".

The download links for the IAD dataset are provided in dataset.md.

The file model.py provide the defination of deep learning models used our paper.

The file train.py is the script for model training.

The file cal_auc.py calculates the AUC metrics for different anomaly scores, which include PER, MSE, MAE, LOF, SVM, COV and ISO.
